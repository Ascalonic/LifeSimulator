# LifeSimulator
Creation, Proliferation and Destruction of life, simulated

Life simulator simulates real-world cycle of life, going through birth, life (resource-consumption, reproduction, movement, predation) and death by using tiny dots.

The dots have **Energy** which needs to be kept up to survive. The energy is acquired by consuming resources (food) spread unevenly across the
land. The dots also have a **life span**, expiry of which, results in death, as much as voiding of their energy does.

The dots can sometimes shift to **predatory-mood**, choosing to kill and salvage resources of their fellows. 

The dots have **senses** which are directed in four directions, sensing the food and other dots around them. Using the experience (learning through experience) they **move around using their senses**.

The dots can also **reproduce**, after hitting a specific energy level, age and a mood - creating multiple children which **inherits traits** of their parent with slightly random difference.

The dots also have a characteristic, named **size** which denotes the size of the dot - indicating their strength. The size also affects their energy consumption.

Another interesting characteristics is **social interaction**. If one dot is seen running out of energy, a kin (dictated by their virtual
DNA) can help it. The helped dot will interact and will learn some behaviors of the helper (which may primarily result in the
former following the latter).
